## Project Summary
We want to build a workout web-app that allows fitness enthusiasts and beginners to easily organize their training, track their progress and develop a discipline towards better health. The website we build aims to be a no-frills, fast, and simple platform for you to record your workout details, along with having your preferred schedule and information saved in your account so that it is accessible from any device. A lot of workout apps today do not cover all the features needed for a user to have a complete overview of their training - not only do we want to log a userâ€™s data, but also visualize their progress, motivate them, and give them guidance on bettering their technique.
